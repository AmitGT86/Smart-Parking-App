### SMART PARKING APP

An app made using Flutter(for InOut7.0).
> In progress.

#### OBJECTIVE :

* To make parking lots more efficient.
* Reduce chances of theft significantly.
* Reduce the time taken for check-in and check-out of vehicles.
* Display the available parking spaces in a particular parking lot.
* Display the necessary info and the current status of the parking lot.
* Save paper and go digital.

#### FUNCTIONS OF THE APP :

* A smart parking system wherein the driver can check-in and check-out via displaying a unique QR code.
* The system is implemented within an application made using Flutter.
* User needs to either Sign-In or Sign-Up for using the app and his information is to be stored and verified using the Cloud FireBase database and FirebaseAuth Authentication.
* Once the user has logged in, he can generate his unique QR code for displaying at the parking lot and either check-in or check-out.
* Unique QR codes to be generated for each user and each parking lot and their information should be stored in a database using Firebase/MySQL and PHP.
* Once the user gets his QR code scanned and checks in, his data is stored in a dynamic database using MySQL and PHP and the details of the parking lot and available parking spots in the parking lot are displayed in the app.
* To find the available parking spots, use the footage of all the CCTV camera to train an ML model to recognize empty parking spots by using image recognition.
* Now, only the user who has checked-in can check out that particular vehicle. During check-out, compare the user data with the already stored data and check-out only if match is found and then delete that entry.
* Send a notification to the user once the vehicle is checked-out, and also display the amount they need to pay(if any).
* Redirect the user to any selected online payment app if the user selects the option.(optional)

#### HOW TO USE :

* Clone the repository locally using `git clone https://github.com/Code-Shinobis/Smart-Parking-App`.
* Open Android Studio(version 2.3 and above) with Flutter and Dart plug-ins installed.
* Open the cloned project.
* Browse to **pubspec.yaml** file in the **login_page** folder and use the `pub get` command on the dependencies to download and install them.
> You may use pub get directly too. This is to look at the plug-ins which need to be installed for this app.
* Do configurations if necessary(Use `main.dart` as the Dart EntryPoint).
* Open AVD Manager and setup a virtual device(Google Pixel 3A preferred).
* Run the app.
* The app will be built and get installed automatically if everything is correct.
> While running for the first time, `Gradle task 'assembleDebug'...` might take a little time. 

#### IMPORTANT :

* The app isn't complete yet.
> The frontend and some portions of the backend are complete.
* Firebase login and auth is still in progress, so database isn't used for now. Please use "code@gmail.com" as the _User email_ and "shinobis" as the _password_ for logging in or else sign up by opening up the **Sign Up** page.
* Every user has a unique email id and hence the qr code generated is also unique. For now, the user needs to enter his id manually. Once the development is complete, the qr code will be generated automatically.
* The qr code generated by the user needs to be scanned at the parking facility and his data will be stored in a database(in progress).
* Make necessary changes in the package names and elsewhere if you intend to change the name of any class or dart file.

#### REPO DETAILS :

* The folder **login_page** contains the code and other required files.
* The Dart files are located at `login_page/lib`.
* The **Screenshots** folder contains the screenshots of the current app.
